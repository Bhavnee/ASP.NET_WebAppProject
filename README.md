Charak Ayurvedic Hospital
I have made a web application for an ayurvedic hospital that allows the patients to book appointments with the doctors and get information about the doctors.
I have created a form that the patients have to fill in order to book an appointment. After filling the form the user will be directed to the index page where they can see their appointment information. They can update or edit, delete and see the details of their information uploaded by using the links provided at the bottom (edit/details/delete).
For this I created a controller and added index, Create, Delete, Details and Edits methods to add CRUD functionality to it. I created 5 razor views for this controller respectively and one model.
I have created a page that lists all the doctors in the hospital, their specializations and a link to know about them.
I have made a controller and views for it that contains an index method and 4 more methods that contain the information about the different doctors.


Reference:
1. I took the reference of the class code because I was getting stucked at many places and getting errors. I have used the class code for the functionality.
2. I have used bootstrap for the front-end.
