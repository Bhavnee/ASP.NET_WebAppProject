Charak Ayurvedic Hospital
I have made a web application for an ayurvedic hospital that allows the patients to book appointments with the doctors. I have created a form that the patients have to fill 
in order to book an appointment. After filling the form the user will be directed to the index page where they can see their appointment information. They can update or edit,
delete and see the details of their information uploaded by using the links provided at the bottom (edit/details/delete).

Reference:
1. I took the reference of the class code because I was getting stucked at many places and getting errors. I have used the class code for the functionality.
2. I have used bootstrap for the front-end.
